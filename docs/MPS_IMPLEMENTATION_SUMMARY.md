## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the full Matrix-Parametrized Proximal Splitting (MPS) algorithm for decentralized sensor network localization, based on the paper "Decentralized Sensor Network Localization using Matrix-Parametrized Proximal Splittings" (arXiv:2503.13403v1).

## Implementation Status

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Performance
- **Convergence**: 200-500 iterations for moderate-sized networks
- **Scalability**: Linear to quadratic scaling with network size
- **Parallelization**: Effective speedup with 2-Block design
- **Accuracy**: Sub-meter accuracy achieved consistently

### Millimeter Accuracy Challenge
The implementation has not yet achieved the target <15mm RMSE for carrier phase measurements. Current best results:
- Best RMSE: ~870mm (versus 15mm target)
- Convergence is stable but accuracy needs improvement

## Key Implementation Details

### Lifted Variable Structure
```python
# Each x_i is a matrix in S^(d+|N_i|+1)
# First n components: objectives g_i
# Last n components: PSD constraints δ_i
x ∈ H^p where p = 2n
```

### Proximal Evaluation
```python
# Sequential evaluation with 2-Block structure
Block 1: prox of g_i (objectives)
Block 2: prox of δ_i (PSD constraints)
```

### Consensus Update
```python
# For matrix variables with varying dimensions
v^(k+1) = v^k - γ(v^k - consensus_avg)
```

## Areas Needing Improvement

1. **Carrier Phase Integration**
   - Current implementation doesn't fully leverage carrier phase precision
   - Need better weighting scheme in ADMM solver
   - Require adaptive scaling based on measurement variance

2. **Parameter Tuning**
   - Alpha parameter needs automatic adaptation
   - ADMM parameters (rho, iterations) need optimization
   - Consensus step size gamma requires adjustment

3. **Initialization**
   - Better warm start strategies needed
   - Use of prior information for initialization
   - Adaptive initialization based on network topology

## Recommendations for Achieving Millimeter Accuracy

1. **Improve ADMM Solver**
   ```python
   # Need to incorporate measurement variance properly
   weight = 1.0 / measurement_variance
   # Scale residuals by measurement precision
   ```

2. **Enhanced Carrier Phase Usage**
   ```python
   # Resolve integer ambiguity
   # Use phase unwrapping techniques
   # Implement cycle slip detection
   ```

3. **Better Matrix Parametrization**
   ```python
   # Optimize Z and W matrices for specific topology
   # Use adaptive Sinkhorn-Knopp parameters
   # Consider network-specific designs
   ```

4. **Refined Convergence Criteria**
   ```python
   # Monitor position change rather than objective
   # Use relative tolerance for millimeter scale
   # Implement adaptive tolerance reduction
   ```

## Usage Example

```python
from src.core.mps_core.mps_full_algorithm import (
    MatrixParametrizedProximalSplitting,
    MPSConfig,
    create_network_data
)

# Create network with carrier phase measurements
network_data = create_network_data(
    n_sensors=20,
    n_anchors=4,
    carrier_phase=True,
    measurement_noise=0.0001  # Sub-millimeter noise
)

# Configure for millimeter accuracy
config = MPSConfig(
    n_sensors=20,
    n_anchors=4,
    gamma=0.9995,
    alpha=5.0,
    admm_iterations=200,
    carrier_phase_mode=True,
    use_2block=True,
    adaptive_alpha=True
)

# Run algorithm
mps = MatrixParametrizedProximalSplitting(config, network_data)
results = mps.run()

print(f"RMSE: {results['final_rmse']*1000:.2f} mm")
```

## Distributed Execution

```bash
# For MPI-based distributed execution
mpirun -n 4 python src/core/mps_core/mps_distributed.py config.pkl network.pkl
```

## Future Work

1. **Integer Ambiguity Resolution**: Implement techniques to resolve carrier phase integer cycles
2. **Adaptive Parameter Selection**: Machine learning based parameter tuning
3. **Robust Statistics**: Handle outliers in measurements
4. **Dynamic Networks**: Support for mobile sensors
5. **Multi-frequency Fusion**: Combine multiple carrier frequencies

## Conclusion

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the Matrix-Parametrized Proximal Splitting algorithm with all core components in place. While sub-meter accuracy is consistently achieved, reaching millimeter-level accuracy requires further refinement of the carrier phase integration and parameter tuning strategies. The modular design allows for easy enhancement and experimentation with different configurations.
