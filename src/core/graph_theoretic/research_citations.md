## Implementation Justifications

### Why Graph Laplacian?
- Encodes network topology naturally
- Enables distributed consensus algorithms
- Spectral properties directly relate to performance

### Why Belief Propagation?
- Naturally distributed (message passing)
- Handles uncertainty probabilistically
- Scales to large networks

### Why Spectral Initialization?
- Provides globally consistent initial positions
- Minimizes embedding distortion
- Computationally efficient

### Why Hierarchical Processing?
- Reduces complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n)
- Preserves global information at each scale
- Natural match to anchor-sensor structure

## Expected Performance Based on Literature

| Approach | Literature Reference | Reported Performance |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Centralized MLE | "Performance limits..." | 85-95% CRLB |
| SDP Relaxation | "Semidefinite programming..." | 70-80% CRLB |
| Belief Propagation | "Cooperative localization..." | 40-50% CRLB |
| Graph Laplacian Consensus | "Distributed localization..." | 35-45% CRLB |
| Our Integrated Approach | Combining above | 45-55% CRLB |

## Notes on Research Gaps

1. Most papers test with >8 anchors, we use 4-6
2. Literature often assumes low noise (1-2%), we test at 5%
3. Few papers report actual CRLB efficiency percentages
4. MPI/truly distributed implementations rarely evaluated
