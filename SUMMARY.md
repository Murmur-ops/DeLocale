# Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a complete decentralized sensor network localization system based on the Barkley & Bassett (2025) paper. The implementation includes both MPI-based distributed computation and a threaded version for single-machine simulation.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Core Algorithm Implementation ✓

- **Matrix-Parametrized Proximal Splitting (MPS)**: Full implementation with proper 2-Block structure
- **ADMM Baseline**: Complete decentralized ADMM for comparison
- **Distributed Sinkhorn-Knopp**: For generating doubly stochastic matrix parameters
- **L Matrix Operations**: Proper computation of L from Z = 2I - L - L^T

### 2. Threading Implementation ✓

- **snl_threaded_full.py**: Complete threading-based implementation that mirrors MPI functionality
- **ThreadedCommunicator**: Thread-safe message passing between sensors
- **Synchronization**: Proper barriers for 2-Block design
- **Performance**: Enables testing without MPI installation

### 3. Tracking and Metrics ✓

- **Objective History**: Full tracking of objective values per iteration
- **Error Metrics**: Relative error computation against true positions
- **Constraint Violations**: PSD constraint monitoring
- **Early Termination**: Automatic stopping when objective stagnates

### 4. Testing Infrastructure ✓

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for core algorithms
- **Integration Tests**: Full algorithm comparison tests
- **Communication Tests**: Verification of 2-Block patterns
- **Standalone Tests**: Threading functionality without MPI

- Early termination reduces unnecessary computation
- Threading implementation produces identical results to MPI
- 2-Block design enables parallel execution

## Next Steps

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Warm Start for Mobile Sensors** (Medium Priority)
   - Implement velocity-based prediction
   - Initialize from previous solutions
   
2. **Performance Benchmarks** (Low Priority)
   - Systematic comparison across network sizes
   - Communication overhead analysis
   
3. **Distributed Logging** (Low Priority)
   - Enhanced debugging capabilities
   - Performance profiling tools

### Usage

To run the threaded implementation:
```bash
python snl_threaded_full.py
```

To run with MPI (requires mpi4py):
```bash
mpirun -np 10 python snl_main_full.py
```

To run unit tests:
```bash
python tests/test_core_algorithms.py
```

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully reproduces the decentralized sensor network localization algorithm from the paper. The threading version enables easy testing and development without MPI, while the MPI version provides true distributed computation. All high-priority tasks have been completed, and the system is ready for experiments and further enhancements.
